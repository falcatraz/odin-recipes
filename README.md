I will do a mini HTML project concurrent with The Odin Project

This was an excellent learning and practicing experience for myself. I was able to comfortably work with
html and the elements that we learned about during this first part of the course
It was not too bad this time around, and thankfully, my CLI use experience paid off in
being able to understand working with relative file/folder paths. I knew that . is referring to the directory
we are on while .. refers to the precious directory
